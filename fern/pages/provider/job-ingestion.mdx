JobGorilla supports a wide variety of job data ingestion methods. This page provides an overview of the different
methods available to Job Providers.

<Note>Our goal is to make getting your job data into JobGorilla reliably, predictably and easily.  If you dont see an
ingestion method here that works for your organization, please reach out to us so we can figure out a way that works
for all of our customers.</Note>

## Ingestion Methods

### Snowflake (Preferred)
Create a data table in your Snowflake account and share the data with JobGorilla. We will plugin the table name into
your onboarding form and have your jobs live in JobGorilla in no time.

<Tip>Contact JobGorilla support for the latest table schema and to get started.</Tip>

### Landing Zone
We have the option for you to drop an export file in a shared and secured location such as Google Drive or One Drive.
Our system will pick up the file and ingest the jobs into JobGorilla.

<Tip>Contact JobGorilla support for the latest file format to get started.</Tip>

### API - Coming Soon
When our API ingestion is in place you will be able to update JobGorilla with your job data in real-time by posting
payloads to our REST endpoints.
