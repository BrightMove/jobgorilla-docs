## Ingestion Methods

### Snowflake (Preferred)
Create a data table in your Snowflake account and share the data with JobGorilla. We will plugin the table name into
your onboarding form and have your jobs live in JobGorilla in no time.

<Tip>Job attributes change and morph over time. If you see something missing that is important to one of your feeds, let
  us know and we will get it added.</Tip>
