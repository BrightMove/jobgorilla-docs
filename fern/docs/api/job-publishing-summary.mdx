The Job Publishing API provides the core operations for managing job postings in the JobGorilla system. Use these
endpoints to publish new jobs, update existing postings, retrieve job details, and remove jobs from distribution.
These operations support comprehensive job data including company information, location details, compensation ranges,
work arrangements (remote, hybrid, on-site), and integration settings for job boards like Indeed.
