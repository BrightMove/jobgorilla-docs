When a Job Board requests a job feed, unless otherwise specifically instructed to pull a feed with a custom URL, the feed request and data are described here.

## Request the Feed

When you register as a JobGorilla certified job board, you assigned a URL and Key to get your job feed.

<Tip>These are referred to as your JobGorilla Job Board ID & Job Board Key.</Tip>

The request URL is `http://feed.jobgorilla.com/feed/board/${JobBoardID}`

It will be difficult to pull your feed with a browser since there are some important `Header` elements that must be included.

| Header             | Value(s)                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `X-JobGorilla-Key` | Your Job Board Key               |
| `Accept`           | `application/json` or `text/xml` |
| `Accept-Encoding`  | `utf-8`                          |

Here is an example CURL request to get a job feed.

```shell
curl -X GET "https://feed.jobgorilla.com/feed/board/d01b5273-36d5-4f61-94d3-cf6b1212ec15" \
-H "X-JobGorilla-Key: 1a6e5f1c-169e-428c-91b3-5dd6f7c5862f" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Accept-Encoding: utf-8"
```

## Job Board Preferences

There are several preferences that need to be configured when your Job Board is onboarded. These preferences can be changed and will determine which jobs are in your feed.

| ID | Preference   | Default | Description                                          |
|----|--------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | job_age_days | `90`    | How old (in days) are the jobs included in the feed. |
| 2  | direct_hire  | `false` | Include direct hire jobs.                            |
| 3  | staffing     | `false` | Include jobs from staffing companies.                |
