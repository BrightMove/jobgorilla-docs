JobGorilla supports screener questions that can be presented to job applicants during the application process. This page outlines the specifications for implementing and delivering screener questions via the `screener_questions_url` field.

<Note>
  Screener questions allow you to qualify candidates early in the application process, improving the quality of applicants and reducing time-to-hire.
</Note>

## Overview

The `screener_questions_url` field in your job data enables you to provide a URL that JobGorilla will query to obtain a list of screening questions for a specific job. When a candidate applies to a job with screener questions enabled, these questions will be presented to the applicant as part of the application flow.

## Endpoint Requirements

When JobGorilla sends a request to your `screener_questions_url`:

- The request will be a `GET` request
- The URL may include a query parameter with the job ID
- Your endpoint must return a JSON response containing a list of `ScreenerQuestion` objects

<Tip>
  Ensure your endpoint has minimal latency to provide a smooth applicant experience. We recommend a response time under 500ms.
</Tip>

## Response Format

Your endpoint must return a list of `ScreenerQuestion` objects in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "q1",
    "type": "select",
    "required": true,
    "requiredCorrect": false,
    "question": "How many years of experience do you have with Java?",
    "options": [
      {
        "label": "Less than 1 year",
        "value": "0-1",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "label": "1-3 years",
        "value": "1-3",
        "correct": false
      },
      {
        "label": "3+ years",
        "value": "3+",
        "correct": true
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "q2",
    "type": "text",
    "required": true,
    "question": "What is your GitHub username?"
  }
]
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep it concise**: Limit the number of questions to 5-7 to prevent applicant drop-off
- **Make it relevant**: Only ask questions that help qualify candidates for the specific role
- **Use branching logic**: Consider using the `requiredCorrect` flag to filter candidates based on must-have qualifications
- **Ensure reliability**: Your endpoint should have high availability and fast response times
- **Test thoroughly**: Validate your questions with test applicants before going live

<Note>
  Your endpoint should be highly available and have minimal latency to ensure a smooth applicant experience.
