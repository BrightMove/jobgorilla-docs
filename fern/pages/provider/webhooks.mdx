Page title: Webhooks
Description: Webhooks are used to communicate back to the Job Provider when a job event has been triggered.
---

The `Job` lifecycle is closely measured and monitored by JobGorilla to provide the best possible experience for both the
Job Provider and the Job Board. To facilitate this, JobGorilla provides a webhook system that allows the Job Provider
to receive notifications when a job event has been triggered.

## Registering Webhooks
Webhooks can be registered by opening a support ticket with JobGorilla. The support team will provide you with a
confirmation when the webhook has been provisioned.

Please provide the following information when registering a webhook:

  ### Webhook URL
    The URL of the webhook endpoint. This is the URL where the webhook payload will be sent.
    - Must be HTTPS
    - Must Accept POST requests
    - Must Accept `application/json` content type
  ### Event Types
    The list of event types that you would like to receive notifications for.
    - `RECEIVED`

## Event Types (Coming Soon)
| Event Type | Description                                                                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SCORED`   | The job has been scored by the intelligence with the attached metadata about the score. |
| `VIEWED`   | The job has been viewed on a Job Board.                                                 |
| `APPLIED`  | The job has been applied to on a Job Board.                                             |

### `RECEIVED`
When a job is seen for the first time in the Ingestion feed, JobGorilla sends a `RECEIVED` event to the Job Provider.
This event can be used to let your customers know that the job has been processed for inclusion in job feed and will
be queued up for a job score.

### `REMOVED`
When a job is removed from the Ingestion feed, JobGorilla sends a `REMOVED` event to the Job Provider.

### `PULLED`
When a job is pulled by a Job Board, JobGorilla sends a `PULLED` event to the Job Provider. This event can be used to
let your customers know which Job Boards have the job and are publishing it for views and applications.

## Webhook Payload
The webhook payload is a JSON object that contains the following fields:

| Field        | Description                                                  |

| `eventType`  | The type of event that has been triggered.                   |
